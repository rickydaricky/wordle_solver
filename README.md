# Wordle Solver

This program opens a Chrome instance of the wordle website and attempts to solve it for you. 

It's able to solve most words within the 6 attempts, but there are a few exceptions (see results.csv for the number of attempts each word requires)

## Usage

Run main.py on your local environment. A Google Chrome instance should pop up, load the Wordle website, and fill in words for you sequentially.
